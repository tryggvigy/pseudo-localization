    <blockquote>
      <i>FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO</i>
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Who's there?</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Long live the king!</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Bernardo?</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>He.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>You come most carefully upon your hour.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,</a><br />
      <a>And I am sick at heart.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Have you had quiet guard?</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Not a mouse stirring.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Well, good night.</a><br />
      <a>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</a><br />
      <a>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?</a><br />
      <p><i>Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Friends to this ground.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>And liegemen to the Dane.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Give you good night.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>O, farewell, honest soldier:</a><br />
      <a>Who hath relieved you?</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>FRANCISCO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Bernardo has my place.</a><br />
      <a>Give you good night.</a><br />
      <p><i>Exit</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Holla! Bernardo!</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Say,</a><br />
      <a>What, is Horatio there?</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>A piece of him.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>I have seen nothing.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</a><br />
      <a>And will not let belief take hold of him</a><br />
      <a>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</a><br />
      <a>Therefore I have entreated him along</a><br />
      <a>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</a><br />
      <a>That if again this apparition come,</a><br />
      <a>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Sit down awhile;</a><br />
      <a>And let us once again assail your ears,</a><br />
      <a>That are so fortified against our story</a><br />
      <a>What we have two nights seen.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Well, sit we down,</a><br />
      <a>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Last night of all,</a><br />
      <a>When yond same star that's westward from the pole</a><br />
      <a>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</a><br />
      <a>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</a><br />
      <a>The bell then beating one,--</a><br />
      <p><i>Enter Ghost</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>It would be spoke to.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>Question it, Horatio.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,</a><br />
      <a>Together with that fair and warlike form</a><br />
      <a>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</a><br />
      <a>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>It is offended.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote><a> See, it stalks away!</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</a><br />
      <p><i>Exit Ghost</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote><a>'Tis gone, and will not answer.</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</a><br />
      <a>Is not this something more than fantasy?</a><br />
      <a>What think you on't?</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Before my God, I might not this believe</a><br />
      <a>Without the sensible and true avouch</a><br />
      <a>Of mine own eyes.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote><a> Is it not like the king?</a><br /></blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>As thou art to thyself:</a><br />
      <a>Such was the very armour he had on</a><br />
      <a>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</a><br />
      <a>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</a><br />
      <a>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</a><br />
      <a>'Tis strange.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</a><br />
      <a>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>In what particular thought to work I know not;</a><br />
      <a>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</a><br />
      <a>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</a><br />
      <a>Why this same strict and most observant watch</a><br />
      <a>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</a><br />
      <a>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</a><br />
      <a>And foreign mart for implements of war;</a><br />
      <a>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</a><br />
      <a>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</a><br />
      <a>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</a><br />
      <a>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</a><br />
      <a>Who is't that can inform me?</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>That can I;</a><br />
      <a>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</a><br />
      <a>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</a><br />
      <a>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</a><br />
      <a>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</a><br />
      <a>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--</a><br />
      <a>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--</a><br />
      <a>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</a><br />
      <a>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</a><br />
      <a>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</a><br />
      <a>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</a><br />
      <a>Against the which, a moiety competent</a><br />
      <a>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</a><br />
      <a>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</a><br />
      <a>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</a><br />
      <a>And carriage of the article design'd,</a><br />
      <a>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</a><br />
      <a>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</a><br />
      <a>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</a><br />
      <a>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</a><br />
      <a>For food and diet, to some enterprise</a><br />
      <a>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--</a><br />
      <a>As it doth well appear unto our state--</a><br />
      <a>But to recover of us, by strong hand</a><br />
      <a>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</a><br />
      <a>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</a><br />
      <a>Is the main motive of our preparations,</a><br />
      <a>The source of this our watch and the chief head</a><br />
      <a>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>I think it be no other but e'en so:</a><br />
      <a>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</a><br />
      <a>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</a><br />
      <a>That was and is the question of these wars.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</a><br />
      <a>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</a><br />
      <a>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</a><br />
      <a>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</a><br />
      <a>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</a><br />
      <a>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</a><br />
      <a>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</a><br />
      <a>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</a><br />
      <a>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</a><br />
      <a>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</a><br />
      <a>As harbingers preceding still the fates</a><br />
      <a>And prologue to the omen coming on,</a><br />
      <a>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</a><br />
      <a>Unto our climatures and countrymen.--</a><br />
      <a>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</a><br />
      <p><i>Re-enter Ghost</i></p>

      <a>If there be any good thing to be done,</a><br />
      <a>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</a><br />
      <a>Speak to me:</a><br />
      <p><i>Cock crows</i></p>
      <a>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</a><br />
      <a>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</a><br />
      <a>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</a><br />
      <a>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</a><br />
      <a>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</a><br />
      <a>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>

    <blockquote><a>Do, if it will not stand.</a><br /></blockquote>

      <a>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</a><br />
      <a>To offer it the show of violence;</a><br />
      <a>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</a><br />
      <a>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>BERNARDO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>And then it started like a guilty thing</a><br />
      <a>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</a><br />
      <a>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</a><br />
      <a>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</a><br />
      <a>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</a><br />
      <a>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</a><br />
      <a>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</a><br />
      <a>To his confine: and of the truth herein</a><br />
      <a>This present object made probation.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>MARCELLUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</a><br />
      <a>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</a><br />
      <a>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</a><br />
      <a>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</a><br />
      <a>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</a><br />
      <a>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</a><br />
      <a>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</a><br />
      <a>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</a><br />

      <a>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</a><br />
      <a>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</a><br />
      <a>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</a><br />
      <a>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</a><br />
      <a>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</a><br />
      <a>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</a><br />
      <a>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</a><br />

    <a><b>KING CLAUDIUS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death</a><br />
      <a>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</a><br />
      <a>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</a><br />
      <a>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</a><br />
      <a>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</a><br />
      <a>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</a><br />
      <a>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</a><br />
      <a>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</a><br />
      <a>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</a><br />
      <a>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--</a><br />
      <a>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</a><br />
      <a>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</a><br />
      <a>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--</a><br />
      <a>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</a><br />
      <a>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</a><br />
      <a>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</a><br />
      <a>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</a><br />
      <a>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</a><br />
      <a>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death</a><br />
      <a>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</a><br />
      <a>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</a><br />
      <a>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,</a><br />
      <a>Importing the surrender of those lands</a><br />
      <a>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</a><br />
      <a>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</a><br />
      <a>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</a><br />
      <a>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</a><br />
      <a>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--</a><br />
      <a>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</a><br />
      <a>Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress</a><br />
      <a>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</a><br />
      <a>The lists and full proportions, are all made</a><br />
      <a>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</a><br />
      <a>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</a><br />
      <a>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</a><br />
      <a>Giving to you no further personal power</a><br />
      <a>To business with the king, more than the scope</a><br />
      <a>Of these delated articles allow.</a><br />

      <a>So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust</a><br />
      <a>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:</a><br />
      <a>O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!</a><br />
      <a>From me, whose love was of that dignity</a><br />
      <a>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</a><br />
      <a>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</a><br />
      <a>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</a><br />
      <a>To those of mine!</a><br />
      <a>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</a><br />
      <a>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</a><br />
      <a>So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,</a><br />
      <a>Will sate itself in a celestial bed,</a><br />
      <a>And prey on garbage.</a><br />
      <a>But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;</a><br />
      <a>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</a><br />
      <a>My custom always of the afternoon,</a><br />
      <a>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</a><br />
      <a>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</a><br />
      <a>And in the porches of my ears did pour</a><br />
      <a>The leperous distilment; whose effect</a><br />
      <a>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</a><br />
      <a>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</a><br />
      <a>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</a><br />
      <a>And with a sudden vigour doth posset</a><br />
      <a>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</a><br />
      <a>The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;</a><br />
      <a>And a most instant tetter bark'd about,</a><br />
      <a>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,</a><br />
      <a>All my smooth body.</a><br />
      <a>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand</a><br />
      <a>Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:</a><br />
      <a>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</a><br />
      <a>Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,</a><br />
      <a>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</a><br />
      <a>With all my imperfections on my head:</a><br />
      <a>O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</a><br />
      <a>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</a><br />
      <a>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</a><br />
      <a>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</a><br />
      <a>But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,</a><br />
      <a>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</a><br />
      <a>Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven</a><br />
      <a>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,</a><br />
      <a>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!</a><br />
      <a>The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</a><br />
      <a>And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:</a><br />
      <a>Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</a><br />

      <a>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</a><br />

      <a>Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</a><br />
      <a>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</a><br />

      <a>Make mad the guilty and appal the free,</a><br />

      <a>'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be</a><br />
      <a>But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall</a><br />
      <a>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</a><br />
      <a>I should have fatted all the region kites</a><br />
      <a>With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!</a><br />
      <a>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!</a><br />
      <a>O, vengeance!</a><br />
      <a>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</a><br />
      <a>That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,</a><br />
      <a>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</a><br />
      <a>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,</a><br />
      <a>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,</a><br />
      <a>A scullion!</a><br />
      <a>Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard</a><br />
      <a>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</a><br />
      <a>Have by the very cunning of the scene</a><br />
      <a>Been struck so to the soul that presently</a><br />
      <a>They have proclaim'd their malefactions;</a><br />
      <a>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</a><br />
      <a>With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players</a><br />
      <a>Play something like the murder of my father</a><br />
      <a>Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;</a><br />
      <a>I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,</a><br />
      <a>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</a><br />
      <a>May be the devil: and the devil hath power</a><br />
      <a>To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps</a><br />
      <a>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</a><br />
      <a>As he is very potent with such spirits,</a><br />
      <a>Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds</a><br />
      <a>More relative than this: the play 's the thing</a><br />
      <a>Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.</a><br />

      <a>That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,</a><br />

      <a>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,</a><br />
      <a>That thou so many princes at a shot</a><br />
      <a>So bloodily hast struck?</a><br />

    <a><b>First Ambassador</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>The sight is dismal;</a><br />
      <a>And our affairs from England come too late:</a><br />
      <a>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,</a><br />
      <a>To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,</a><br />
      <a>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:</a><br />
      <a>Where should we have our thanks?</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Not from his mouth,</a><br />
      <a>Had it the ability of life to thank you:</a><br />
      <a>He never gave commandment for their death.</a><br />
      <a>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,</a><br />
      <a>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</a><br />
      <a>Are here arrived give order that these bodies</a><br />
      <a>High on a stage be placed to the view;</a><br />
      <a>And let me speak to the yet unknowing world</a><br />
      <a>How these things came about: so shall you hear</a><br />
      <a>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</a><br />
      <a>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</a><br />
      <a>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,</a><br />
      <a>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook</a><br />
      <a>Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I</a><br />
      <a>Truly deliver.</a><br />

    <a><b>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a> Let us haste to hear it,</a><br />
      <a>And call the noblest to the audience.</a><br />
      <a>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:</a><br />
      <a>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,</a><br />
      <a>Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</a><br />
    </blockquote>

    <a><b>HORATIO</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</a><br />
      <a>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;</a><br />
      <a>But let this same be presently perform'd,</a><br />
      <a>Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance</a><br />
      <a>On plots and errors, happen.</a><br />

    <a><b>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</b></a>
    <blockquote>
      <a>Let four captains</a><br />
      <a>Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;</a><br />
      <a>For he was likely, had he been put on,</a><br />
      <a>To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,</a><br />
      <a>The soldiers' music and the rites of war</a><br />
      <a>Speak loudly for him.</a><br />
      <a>Take up the bodies: such a sight as this</a><br />
      <a>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</a><br />
      <a>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</a><br />
